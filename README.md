# Conquering Responsive Layouts: 21-Day Challenge

This repository documents my progress and solutions for the [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) course by Kevin Powell.

## Project Overview

The 21-day "drip" challenge aims to transform a "desktop-first" approach—often leading to struggles with mobile adaptations—into a seamless "mobile-first" mindset. Key focuses include:

- **Mobile-First Workflow**: Crafting CSS that scales upward from mobile devices, rather than retrofitting desktop designs for smaller screens.
- **Relative Units**: Leveraging `em`, `rem`, and percentages over fixed pixels to allow elements to adapt fluidly.
- **Flexbox Mastery**: Creating robust layouts and navigation systems that maintain responsiveness across devices.
- **The "Web Wants to be Responsive" Mantra**: Embracing the browser's inherent behaviors to build intuitive, flexible designs without unnecessary overrides.

## Key Challenges Completed

- **Days 1-7**: Fundamentals of percentages, `max-width`, and avoiding fixed heights for better adaptability.
- **Days 8-14**: In-depth exploration of Flexbox for precise alignment, distribution, and responsive navigation.
- **Days 15-21**: Advanced projects incorporating media queries and sophisticated layout strategies to solidify responsive principles.
